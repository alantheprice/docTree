# This is a markdown viewer for viewing markdown within a development environment. 

A simple Single page app that is designed to make it simple to view markdown documentation within a project.

It is designed for well documented projects using many linked markdown files to document portions of the application. As long as all markdown files are linked with the main README.md, the markdown-viewer will find all linked markdown files and create a sidebar menu structure to mirror the directory stucture where linked documents appear.

### Usage

To use the markdown viewer you will need to run `npm install marked-tree`
